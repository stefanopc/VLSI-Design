\section{Conclusion}

VLSI turned out to be a problem of non-negligible complexity: the goal was to find a good model through a combination of constraints and types of search in order to get the most efficient solution with as smaller solving times as possible. \\
In both cases with CP and SMT we were able to get satisfactory results, in particular in the base model which does not allow rotation (which adds further complexity). In particular, among the two techniques, CP managed to obtained the best results by solving a larger number of instances. In all the cases, as the number of circuits in the plate increases, the complexity raises in the same manner, and the solver may not able to find a solution within the time limit of 300 seconds.
