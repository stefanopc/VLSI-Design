\section{Introduction}

VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) refers to the trend of integrating circuits into silicon chips. The modern trend of shrinking transistor sizes, allowing engineers to fit more and more transistors into the same area of silicon, has pushed the integration of more and more functions of cellphone circuitry into a single silicon die (i.e. plate). This enabled the modern cellphone to mature into a powerful tool that shrank from the size of a large brick-sized unit to a device small enough to comfortably carry in a pocket or purse, with a video camera, touchscreen, and other advanced features.

Given a fixed-width plate and a list of rectangular circuits, the problem consists in deciding how to place the circuits on the plate in order to minimize the length of the final device. The combinatorial optimization problem will be modeled and solved with Constraint Programming (CP) and Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). Moreover, in addition to a base model, it has been developed a model which takes into account the rotation of the circuits, in order to compare the solutions and their complexity.
